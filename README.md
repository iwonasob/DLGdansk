# DLGdansk

This is the material for International Summer School on Deep Learning in Gdansk.

1. To be able to run the code be sure to download UrbanSound8k dataset:

[UrbanSound8k](https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/urbansounddataset/urbansound8k.html)

2. If you want to render the slides properly you need to clone reveal.js to the same directory

```
git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js
```

3. Be sure to install appropriate libraries:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

Have fun and let me know if you have any suggestions!
