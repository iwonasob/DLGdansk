This is the material for International Summer School on Deep Learning in Gdansk.

1. Be sure to install appropriate libraries:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

2. To be able to run the code be sure to download UrbanSound8k dataset:

[UrbanSound8k](https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/urbansounddataset/urbansound8k.html)

3. If you want to render the slides properly you need to clone reveal.js to the same directory as this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js
```

Then, run the following command:

jupyter nbconvert NAME_OF_THE_NOTEBOOK.ipynb --to slides



Have fun and let me know if you have any suggestions!
